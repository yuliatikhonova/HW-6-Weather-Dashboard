For this project we were asked to create a weather app that retrieves data from a third-party API.

We were asked to when we search for a city, we would present the current and future conditions for that city. Also the city is added to the search history. For example:

We were also asked to have the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index in the current weather. For example:

For the 5 day forecast we were asked to display the date, icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, and the humidity. For example:
